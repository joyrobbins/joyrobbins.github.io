    <p><h3>Check out the (mostly free) resources I'm using to learn how to code!</h3></p>
    <p><h4><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development" target="_blank">Codecademy: Web Development Path</a></h4>
        <p>I paid for the PRO version of this program after my free trial ran out. I love the step-by-step teaching method, the mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript throughout the course, and the ability to write and test your code right on the page. I was a real beginner when I started (with only a little experience with HTML), so I needed a mix of multiple resources to supplement this program.</p>

    <p><h4><a href="https://edabit.com/" target="_blank">Edabit: 10,000+ Coding Practice Challenges (free)</a></h4></p>
        <p>I love, love, love Edabit! This online challenge generator is free and very addictive. You can scaffold your challenges by your experience level (from Very Easy to Expert) and filter your challenges by topic - I've been focusing extra hard on Arrays and Objects to make sure I deepen my understanding of these important topics.</p>

    <p><h4><a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/resources" target="_blank">Women Who Code: Coding Resources (free)</a></h4></p>
        <p>Not only does Women Who Code offer support and networking for women technologists, from novice to expert, they also provide tutorials, reference guides, blog posts, videos, and more. Be sure to see if there is a network or upcoming event in your area!</p>

    <p><h4><a href="https://lesbianswhotech.org/about/" target="_blank">Lesbians Who Tech & Allies (free)</a></h4></p>
        <p>This fantastic organization not only provides support and coding scholarships for LGBTQ+ women, non-binary, and trans people in tech, but also provides free online workshops and networking. You should definitely attend their annual summit(s) to learn from some of the most diverse and most talented voices in the tech field.</p>

    <p><h4><a href="https://www.pyladies.com/about/" target="_blank">Py Ladies (free)</a></h4></p>
        <p>Py Ladies is a worldwide organization of women developers who code in Python, whether full time or part time, newbie or expert. This friendly, outgoing group has Meetups (online social coding events), an active Slack group, and resources available for all levels.</p>

    <p><h4><a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com" target="_blank">Girl Develop It (free)</a></h4></p>
        <p>Girl Develop It is a nonprofit organization that provides free resources to help women and girls learn software development. There are chapters in 5 U.S. cities, as well as community-built curriculum to use and share available to anyone online.</p>
    
    <p><h4><a href="https://download.cnet.com/Algorithm-City-Coding-Game-for-Kids-with-Animals/3000-2111_4-77904442.html" target="_blank">Algorithm City (free with ads)</a></h4></p>
        <p>The game that started it all - for me, at least. Playing this free, simple coding game introduced me to loops and functions, and it made me want to become a producer of code instead of just a consumer of someone else's code. Check out my Future Projects for additional insights into how this game has inspired me.</p>

    <p><h4><a href="https://codecombat.com" target="_blank">Code Combat (free and paid versions)</a></h4></p>
      <p>Code Combat took me to the next level in learning how much fun coding can be! I played the free version in Python before I even knew what Python was, and I enjoyed the immersive "fighting orcs using weapons you earn" gameplay.</p>
