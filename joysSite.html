      <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
      <p>My name is Joy, and I'm a woman from Texas who is teaching herself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this website to share books, resources, and organizations that have helped me along my journey to understanding (and loving) coding. In addition, this website serves as a snapshot of what I've learned in the 8 weeks I've spent studying these resources.</p><p>I hope you find something in these pages to make you love coding as much as I do, and feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joy-robbins-8725a169" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
