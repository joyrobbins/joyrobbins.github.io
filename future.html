    <p><h4>"Code With Friends" App</h4>
        <p>This web app will allow two players to work together to move a character through obstacles that increase in complexity on each progressive level. The best part? Each player has to take a turn coding to move the character through the obstacles. Coding is great. Coding with Friends is even better!</p>

    <p><h4>A Women and LGBTQ+ Friendly Coding Forum</h4></p>
        <p>One of the most intimidating parts of learning to code for me is interacting with others on coding forums. I'd like to collaborate with other women technologists to create a more friendly, inviting forum for women, LGBTQ+, and other people who may not feel comfortable in existing coding forum spaces.</p>

    <p><h4>"Walk With Me" LGBTQ+ Oral History & Travel App</h4></p>
        <p>This app combines the best of oral history and walking tours! Open the app to walk in the footsteps of LGBTQ+ elders and activists as they describe their personal experiences in the very space in which you're walking. Can't travel? No problem. Just take a walk wherever you'd like and listen as history unfolds in your ears.</p>
